When and where is a story dispersed?

Whisper is an online visualization tool for tracing the process of information diffusion on Twitter in real time. It is designed to show the story of information diffusion about events. With Whisper, you can play and see: 
Collective responses: The collective responses to a given topic are summarized through the flow of retweets (represented as "diffusion pathways") and the node sizes of communities, with colors indicating the aggregated sentiments of communities.
Multistep information flow: Original tweets or retweets that initiate significant amount of retweets can be observed through the density of tweets around the center, the density of diffusion pathways and the focused diffusion series, which help identify the opinion leaders in a multistep information flow.
Spatiotemporal trends: The density and orientation of moving retweet glyphs captures whether a given topic is a short burst or a long-lasting trend, and whether the burst or trend differs for different communities over different places.
